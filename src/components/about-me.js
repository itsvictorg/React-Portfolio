Hello, I'm Victor Gonzalez! 
I am a software developer specializing in web development. I have experience in front-end and back-end development. Most of my front-end experience is in JavaScript, React.js, HTML, and CSS. My back-end experience is with Node.js, Express.js, mySQL, and MongoDB.  I am currently enrolled in a full stack coding bootcamp through the University of Texas, Austin. I will be graduating from this program in April of 2023. I also previously completed a 12 month coding program focusing on video game development where I learned C++ and a visual scripting tool called Unreal Engine Blueprints. 
I really enjoy solving problems. I think coding is really exciting because of that. I see it as a puzzle with endless amounts of solutions and finding the most efficient and effective solution is the challenge. 

I am currently seeking a junior developer position to get my career started and learn as much as possible from my team and senior developers.
